# CS-686-Project
This is the paper of CS 686 project, which is a system built with simple neural network like SRCNN, to more advanced ones like ESRGAN and EDSR.

The system is SR system (super resolution system), which is used to improve the resolution of low quality images. The system will choose to output a picture 
based on the metric: PSNR (Peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to measure the performance of the images generated by the models:
- SRCNN
- EDSR
- and ESRGAN

Detailed implementation is not provided here but only the paper.
