School Papers:

- The first paper was the recent (August 2024) CS 686 project, which is a system built with simple neural network like SRCNN, to more advanced ones like ESRGAN and EDSR.

  - The system is SR system (super resolution system), which is used to improve the resolution of low quality images. The system will choose to output a picture 
based on the metric: PSNR (Peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to measure the performance of the images generated by the models:
    - SRCNN
    - EDSR
    - and ESRGAN

  - Detailed implementation is not provided here but only the paper.
- The second paper was back in 2019, which was formulating task matching problems on hyperledger fabric block chain using programming language: `GO`
